                    That geometry is either present or it

## PART I — ATTRACTOR TYPE ASSIGNMENT
## Before any biology is stated

```
Per ATTRACTOR_GEOMETRY_AXIOMS.md (Doc 90),
the first step before any prediction is to
assign the attractor type using the diagnostic
algorithm.

QUESTION 1: Cell of origin?
  The normal cell is the MAMMARY STEM CELL —
  the most primitive cell in the breast hierarchy.
  This is a DIFFERENT cell of origin from every
  other BRCA subtype analyzed in this series.

  Hierarchy of cells previously analyzed:
    Luminal A:      Mature luminal epithelial cell
                    (most differentiated — furthest from stem)
    Luminal B:      Luminal progenitor (partly differentiated)
    HER2-enriched:  Luminal progenitor (diverted by amplicon)
    TNBC:           Luminal progenitor (BRCA1-null, basal prog.)
    ILC:            Lobular epithelial cell (separate lineage)
    Claudin-low:    MAMMARY STEM CELL
                    The least differentiated.
                    The furthest from any committed identity.
                    The closest to the root of the
                    Waddington landscape.

  The mammary stem cell's defining properties:
    — CD44 high / CD24 low — canonical breast stem phenotype
    — ALDH1 high — aldehyde dehydrogenase activity
    — Low or absent expression of luminal lineage markers
      (ESR1, FOXA1, GATA3, PGR all low or absent)
    — Low or absent claudin expression (claudins 3, 4, 7)
    — Low E-cadherin (CDH1) — not locked into epithelial
      architecture
    — Expresses partial EMT programme (VIM, FN1)
    — Expresses pluripotency-associated TFs (SOX2, SNAI1,
      TWIST1 — not embryonic OCT4/NANOG at high level,
      but mesenchymal-stem analogues)
    — Highly immune-infiltrated tumour microenvironment
      (CD8+ T cells, macrophages — consistent with
      stem-like attractors across cancer types)

  The correct terminal destination (normal attractor):
    A mammary stem cell that either:
      — Differentiates toward luminal progenitor
        (→ ultimately mature luminal cell)
      — Differentiates toward myoepithelial progenitor
        (→ ultimately mature myoepithelial cell)
    In normal tissue this cell does not persist in the
    stem state — it differentiates. The false attractor
    in claudin-low is a LOCKED STEM STATE: the cell
    cannot exit the stem programme and commit to either
    luminal or myoepithelial identity. It proliferates
    from within the stem compartment.

QUESTION 2: What programme has been lost?
  The normal mammary stem cell does not express
  strong luminal OR myoepithelial identity — it
  expresses neither fully. What is lost in claudin-low
  is the CAPACITY TO DIFFERENTIATE — not a specific
  identity programme (as in LumA/B where ESR1 is lost)
  but the differentiation gate itself.

  The structural consequence:
    LumA/B/HER2/TNBC: cancer cell has lost a specific
    identity TF programme → false attractor defined
    by what is missing
    ILC: cancer cell has lost structural adhesion
    (CDH1) while retaining identity → false attractor
    defined by architectural dissolution
    Claudin-low: cancer cell cannot exit the stem state
    → false attractor defined by differentiation arrest
    AT THE ROOT of the Waddington landscape

QUESTION 3: Attractor type classification?
  Per ATTRACTOR_GEOMETRY_AXIOMS.md:
    This is a TYPE 4 attractor:
    STEM LOCK — DIFFERENTIATION ARREST AT PROGENITOR ROOT

  The cell is not displaced FROM a mature identity
  (as in LumA, where the mature luminal cell has
  partially escaped its valley).
  The cell NEVER REACHED a mature identity.
  The false attractor is the stem compartment itself,
  expanded and locked.

  This makes claudin-low structurally unique across
  the entire BRCA series:
    All other subtypes = escape from a committed
    identity valley (partial or complete)
    Claudin-low = arrest at the pre-commitment node

  The depth axis for claudin-low is therefore NOT
  defined by loss of a specific identity gene.
  It is defined by DEPTH INTO THE STEM PROGRAMME:
  how far has the cell moved away from any
  differentiation commitment, and how deeply locked
  into the stem-like false attractor is it?
```

---

## PART II — THE NORMAL CELL IDENTITY PROGRAMME
## What the normal mammary stem cell expresses

```
This is the reference against which the cancer
geometry will be read. These are established facts
from the mammary biology literature — not predictions.

NORMAL MAMMARY STEM CELL MARKERS (the terminal
destination being departed from):

PRESENT in normal mammary stem cell:
  CD44:     High — canonical stem cell surface marker
  ALDH1A1:  High — ALDH activity marks mammary stem cells
  CD29:     Integrin beta-1 — stem/basal marker
  KRT14:    Cytokeratin 14 — basal/stem expressed
  KRT5:     Cytokeratin 5 — basal/stem expressed
  TP63:     p63 — basal/stem TF (marks the basal layer)
  ITGA6:    Integrin alpha-6 (CD49f) — mammary stem marker
  SNAI1:    Snail — partial EMT in stem state
  VIM:      Vimentin — mesenchymal/stem marker
  FN1:      Fibronectin — ECM produced by stem cells

LOW/ABSENT in normal mammary stem cell:
  ESR1:     Not expressed — not yet committed to luminal
  FOXA1:    Not expressed — luminal pioneer TF absent
  GATA3:    Not expressed — luminal differentiation TF absent
  PGR:      Not expressed — ER target, therefore absent
  CLDN3:    Low — claudin-3 (junction protein, lost in CL)
  CLDN4:    Low — claudin-4 (junction protein, lost in CL)
  CLDN7:    Low — claudin-7 (junction protein, lost in CL)
  CDH1:     Low — E-cadherin low in stem state
  MKI67:    Low in quiescent stem cells but can be high
            in activated stem/progenitor pool

The claudin-low false attractor:
  Retains and amplifies the stem markers
  Loses all differentiation markers (luminal AND basal)
  Loses claudins (already low in stem — further reduced)
  Gains immune programme (CD274/PD-L1, immune cell TFs)
  Gains partial EMT (TWIST1, ZEB1, VIM elevated)
  Does NOT gain full mesenchymal identity (incomplete EMT)
```

---

## PART III — STRUCTURAL POSITION IN THE BREAST LANDSCAPE
## Read before predictions

```
The five completed subtypes establish the following
structural picture of the breast Waddington landscape:

DIFFERENTIATION AXIS (normal → most displaced):
  Mammary stem cell
  └─ Luminal progenitor
     ├─ Mature luminal (Luminal A) — least displaced
     ├─ Intermediate luminal (Luminal B)
     ├─ Luminal progenitor + HER2 amplicon (HER2-enriched)
     └─ Luminal progenitor + BRCA1 loss (TNBC/basal)
  └─ Lobular progenitor
     └─ Lobular epithelial cell + CDH1 loss (ILC)

Claudin-low sits ABOVE all of these in the hierarchy —
it arises from the root, before any commitment is made.

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR THE GEOMETRY READING:
  1. ESR1/FOXA1/GATA3 should be the LOWEST of any
     BRCA subtype — even lower than TNBC, because
     TNBC at least arises from a luminal progenitor
     that once had partial luminal identity.
     Claudin-low starts before that commitment.

  2. The ER axis established across LumA → LumB →
     HER2 → TNBC should extend to its logical endpoint
     in claudin-low: ESR1 at or near zero.

  3. The basal/stem markers (KRT5, KRT14, VIM, CD44)
     should be HIGHER than in TNBC — TNBC acquires
     basal markers as a false attractor programme,
     but claudin-low starts in the basal/stem
     compartment. The signal should be stronger.

  4. The claudin junction proteins (CLDN3, CLDN4,
     CLDN7) are the defining molecular feature —
     they should be the most specific geometric
     markers of the false attractor.

  5. The immune programme should be high — claudin-low
     has the highest immune infiltration of all
     non-TNBC subtypes. This is consistent with
     stem-like attractors across cancer types
     (they tend to be immune-hot).

  6. The depth axis should be readable as: how much
     of the residual stem programme is present?
     More stem markers = deeper in the false attractor.
     More partial differentiation markers = shallower.
```

## PART IV — PREDICTIONS
## All stated 2026-03-05 before Script 1 runs

---

### P1 — ESR1/FOXA1/GATA3 AT LOWEST LEVELS OF ALL BRCA SUBTYPES

**Direction:**
ESR1 lower than TNBC.
FOXA1 lower than TNBC.
GATA3 lower than TNBC.
All three at or approaching zero expression relative to normal.

**Geometric basis:**
Claudin-low arises from the mammary stem cell — the cell that
precedes luminal commitment in the differentiation hierarchy.
The normal mammary stem cell does not express ESR1, FOXA1, or
GATA3. The false attractor retains the stem cell state. There
is no mechanism by which luminal TFs would be present.

In the completed series:
  LumA:    ESR1 retained, FOXA1 retained, GATA3 retained
  LumB:    ESR1 higher than LumA, FOXA1 equal
  ILC:     ESR1 elevated above normal, FOXA1 elevated
  TNBC:    ESR1 lost, FOXA1 lost, GATA3 lost
  Claudin-low: must extend this trend — ESR1 at or below
           TNBC levels, likely lower, because TNBC at minimum
           arose from a luminal progenitor with transient
           luminal identity. Claudin-low did not.

**What refutation would look like:**
ESR1 equivalent to TNBC but not lower = not refuted,
trend holds. ESR1 significantly higher than TNBC = refuted.
If ESR1 is elevated in claudin-low, the cell-of-origin
assignment is wrong and requires revision.

---

### P2 — VIM/ZEB1/SNAI1 ELEVATED — PARTIAL EMT PROGRAMME PRESENT

**Direction:**
VIM elevated above LumA, above TNBC, and above ILC.
ZEB1 elevated — EMT TF present.
SNAI1 elevated — EMT TF present.
CDH1 (E-cadherin) low — consistent with partial EMT state.
FN1 (fibronectin) elevated — mesenchymal ECM marker.

**Geometric basis:**
Claudin-low tumours are well-established in the literature
to show partial EMT and mesenchymal-like gene expression.
This is structurally predicted by the cell of origin —
the mammary stem cell already expresses a partial
mesenchymal programme (VIM, FN1, SNAI1). The false
attractor amplifies this. The word "partial" is critical:
this is NOT full EMT. ZEB1 and SNAI1 are expected to be
present but not at the levels seen in full spindle-cell
metaplastic carcinoma. This is a stem-like partial EMT,
not a mesenchymal transdifferentiation.

**Critical distinction from ILC:**
ILC has CDH1 loss due to mutation/methylation — a specific
molecular event. In claudin-low, CDH1 is low because the
cell of origin (mammary stem cell) never expressed it
strongly. The mechanism is different. The geometric
output (low CDH1) may appear similar but the cause and
the co-expression context will differ.

**What refutation would look like:**
VIM lower than or equal to LumA = refuted.
ZEB1 not elevated = partially refuted (the EMT arm
of the prediction would not hold).

---

### P3 — CLDN3/CLDN4/CLDN7 THE MOST SPECIFIC GEOMETRIC MARKERS

**Direction:**
CLDN3 lower than all other BRCA subtypes.
CLDN4 lower than all other BRCA subtypes.
CLDN7 lower than all other BRCA subtypes.
The three claudin genes are the defining negative
markers of this attractor — their loss is the
structural fingerprint of the false attractor.

**Geometric basis:**
The claudin-low subtype is named for loss of CLDN3,
CLDN4, and CLDN7. These encode tight junction proteins
that maintain epithelial integrity. In the normal
mammary stem cell they are already low — the false
attractor pushes them further down. No other BRCA
subtype has claudin loss as its defining geometric
event. LumA, LumB, ILC, and even TNBC retain
claudin expression as part of their epithelial
programme. Claudin-low does not.

This prediction is the most direct test of whether the
geometry-first protocol has correctly identified
claudin-low samples in the TCGA dataset. If CLDN3/4/7
are not the lowest of all subtypes in the identified
samples, the sample identification has failed.

**What refutation would look like:**
CLDN3/4/7 equal to or higher than TNBC = refuted.
This would mean the claudin-low samples were not
correctly identified from the TCGA data, or the
subtype classifier is labelling samples incorrectly.

---

### P4 — CD44 HIGH / CD24 LOW — CANONICAL BREAST STEM PHENOTYPE

**Direction:**
CD44 elevated above normal and above all other BRCA subtypes.
CD24 reduced below normal — the CD44-high/CD24-low
stem cell phenotype present at the bulk transcriptomic level.

**Geometric basis:**
CD44-high / CD24-low is the canonical breast cancer stem
cell (BCSC) phenotype established by Al-Hajj et al. 2003.
It marks the most tumourigenic cell fraction in breast cancer
and is concentrated in the claudin-low attractor.
In bulk RNA-seq this signal is expected to be readable
as a population-level shift because claudin-low tumours
are enriched for cells with BCSC identity — this is not
a rare subpopulation in claudin-low, it is the dominant
cell state.

This is a cross-subtype geometric test: CD44/CD24 ratio
should rank: Claudin-low > TNBC > LumB > LumA.
The stem programme rises monotonically as you move
from mature luminal identity toward the stem root.

**What refutation would look like:**
CD44 not elevated, or CD24 not reduced, relative to
TNBC = refuted. The stem phenotype prediction fails.

---

### P5 — NO TP53 MUTATION SIGNATURE AT THE mRNA LEVEL

**Direction:**
TP53 mRNA itself may not be dramatically elevated
(unlike TNBC where TP53 mutation rate is ~80% and
drives a specific transcriptional signature).
The TP53 mutation rate in claudin-low is expected
to be lower than TNBC at the mRNA proxy level.
MDM2 (p53 inhibitor) may be expressed normally.

**Geometric basis:**
TP53 mutation is the dominant driver in TNBC (~80%)
and HER2-enriched (~72%). In claudin-low, the
published mutation landscape is different — TP53
mutation is present but not at TNBC frequency.
The defining events in claudin-low are not point
mutations in a single gate gene (like TP53 in TNBC
or ERBB2 amplification in HER2-enriched) but a
failure of the differentiation gate itself.
This is a programme-level attractor lock, not a
single gene mutation event.

The expected mRNA proxy: TP53 target gene signatures
(CDKN1A, MDM2, BAX) may be less disrupted in
claudin-low than in TNBC. If TP53 is wild-type in
a larger fraction of claudin-low tumours, its
transcriptional targets will be more intact.

**What refutation would look like:**
TP53 target gene signature equivalent to TNBC = refuted.
This would suggest TP53 mutation frequency in the
claudin-low subset is similar to TNBC, which would
challenge the attractor type classification.

---

### P6 — IMMUNE PROGRAMME PRESENT — CD274/PD-L1 AND TIL SIGNATURE

**Direction:**
CD274 (PD-L1) elevated.
CD8A (CD8 T cell marker) elevated.
FOXP3 (Treg marker) elevated.
Immune gene expression programme present at levels
comparable to or exceeding TNBC.
The claudin-low tumour microenvironment is immune-hot.

**Geometric basis:**
Claudin-low has been consistently described in the
literature as having high immune infiltration — some
analyses show higher TIL levels than TNBC proper.
This is structurally expected: stem-like cancer cells
across cancer types tend to reside in immune-infiltrated
microenvironments. The mechanism is not fully established,
but the geometric fact is: claudin-low is immune-hot.

The cross-subtype immune ranking is predicted to be:
Claudin-low ≈ TNBC > LumB > LumA > ILC (ILC is
consistently immune-cold, consistent with the
Type 3 adhesion lock attractor reading).

**What refutation would look like:**
CD274 lower than LumA = refuted.
Immune programme flat or absent = refuted.

---

### P7 — DEPTH AXIS: STEM PROGRAMME DEPTH, NOT IDENTITY LOSS

**Direction:**
The within-claudin-low depth axis is defined by:
  — High end (deepest in attractor): maximal
    CD44, VIM, ZEB1, minimal CLDN3/4/7, minimal CDH1,
    maximal immune programme, maximal ALDH1A1
  — Low end (shallowest): partial recovery of
    claudin expression, partial CDH1, lower VIM,
    residual partial luminal or basal markers

The depth axis for claudin-low is NOT the ER axis
(which was the primary depth axis for LumA/B).
It is NOT the CDH1 axis (which was the primary
depth axis for ILC).
It is the STEM LOCK DEPTH AXIS: how completely has
the cell abandoned differentiation commitment?

**Geometric basis:**
Per the attractor type classification (TYPE 4 —
STEM LOCK), depth is measured as displacement from
the nearest committed identity, not as loss of a
specific TF. The deepest cells are the ones most
completely locked in the undifferentiated stem state.
The shallowest cells show residual identity markers
consistent with partial differentiation toward
one of the two normal daughters (luminal or myoepithelial).

**Structural prediction:**
CLDN3 expression within claudin-low samples will
correlate positively with residual luminal markers
(the cells retaining some claudin expression are
the ones with partial luminal identity remaining).
VIM expression will correlate negatively with any
luminal marker and positively with depth.
These two axes (claudin retention vs. VIM gain)
will be orthogonal within the claudin-low population.

**What refutation would look like:**
No within-group depth structure = refuted.
CLDN3 and VIM moving in the same direction = refuted.

---

### P8 — CROSS-SUBTYPE POSITION: MOST STRUCTURALLY DISTANT FROM LumA

**Direction:**
In PCA or distance analysis across all five completed
BRCA subtypes plus claudin-low:
  — Claudin-low will cluster furthest from Luminal A
  — Claudin-low will sit at the extreme of the
    ER-axis (PC1 in prior analyses)
  — Claudin-low and ILC will NOT cluster together
    (ILC clusters nearest LumA; claudin-low clusters
    nearest TNBC but further out)
  — The distance from claudin-low to ILC will be
    the largest pairwise distance in the breast
    subtype space

**Geometric basis:**
ILC retains the most complete luminal programme of
any BRCA subtype (ESR1 ABOVE normal, FOXA1 ABOVE
normal). Claudin-low has no luminal programme at all.
They are structural opposites within the breast
landscape. ILC's false attractor is defined by what
is retained (luminal identity). Claudin-low's false
attractor is defined by what is absent (all committed
identity). They should be maximally separated in
any high-dimensional distance metric.

**What refutation would look like:**
Claudin-low clustering near ILC = refuted.
Claudin-low not at the extreme of the ER axis = refuted.

---

### P9 — DRUG TARGET GEOMETRY: NO ER, NO HER2, BUT IMMUNE AND STEM TARGETS PRESENT

**Direction:**
Endocrine therapy is NOT a geometric target:
  ESR1 absent → aromatase inhibitors and tamoxifen
  have no receptor to act on.

HER2-targeted therapy is NOT a geometric target:
  ERBB2 is not amplified in claudin-low (it is
  almost never HER2-enriched by PAM50 — these
  are genuinely distinct populations).

Geometrically supported targets from the attractor
structure:

  1. IMMUNE CHECKPOINT — PD-1/PD-L1 axis
     CD274 elevated → PD-L1 present → pembrolizumab
     relevant. The claudin-low attractor is immune-hot.
     This is the same target geometry as TNBC.

  2. ALDH1 / STEM PROGRAMME — experimental
     ALDH1A1 elevated → marks the cancer stem cell
     population locked in the false attractor.
     ALDH inhibitors are in preclinical development.
     Salinomycin-class compounds target stem-like
     attractor states. These are not approved but
     the geometric case is present.

  3. ZEB1/SNAI1 — EMT axis targets
     Partial EMT programme is present. ZEB1 and
     SNAI1 are transcriptional drivers. No approved
     drugs directly target these, but the geometric
     finding is relevant for experimental design.

  4. TROP2 (TACSTD2) — if elevated
     Sacituzumab govitecan (TROP2 ADC) is approved
     for TNBC. If TROP2 is elevated in claudin-low
     (TROP2 expression is present in basal-like
     populations), this extends the ADC rationale
     to claudin-low. This is a conditional prediction:
     TROP2 will be elevated above LumA; whether it
     is equivalent to TNBC requires data.

  5. PARP inhibitors — if BRCA1 dysfunction present
     Claudin-low has some overlap with BRCA1-mutated
     tumours. If BRCA1 expression is low in the
     claudin-low samples, the PARP inhibitor geometric
     rationale applies. This is conditional on the
     BRCA1 signal in the data.

**What refutation would look like:**
ESR1 high in claudin-low = refuted (endocrine target
would be present, attractor type wrong).
ERBB2 elevated = refuted (HER2 target present,
attractor type wrong).
PD-L1 low = partial refutation of the immune target
geometric rationale.

## PART VI — WHAT SCRIPT 1 MUST DO

```
GEOMETRY-FIRST PROTOCOL (v2.0):

STEP 1 — IDENTIFY CLAUDIN-LOW SAMPLES FROM GEOMETRY
  Do not import a classifier label from an external file.
  Identify claudin-low samples using the expression geometry:
    CLDN3 low AND CLDN4 low AND CLDN7 low AND CDH1 low
    AND VIM elevated AND CD44 elevated AND CD24 low
    AND ESR1 low AND ERBB2 not amplified
  Use median splits or clustering on these axes within
  the TCGA-BRCA dataset. The resulting samples are
  the claudin-low population for analysis.
  Cross-validate against published claudin-low calls
  if available as a secondary check only.

STEP 2 — UNFILTERED TOP-MOVER SCAN
  Run the full 20,530-gene scan on claudin-low vs.
  adjacent normal. Report the top 20 gained and top 20
  lost genes without filtering. This is printed FIRST
  before any prediction testing. Read the geometry
  on its own terms before asking whether predictions
  were confirmed.

STEP 3 — NAMED PANEL TESTS
  Test each prediction using the named gene panel:
    Luminal identity axis: ESR1, FOXA1, GATA3, PGR
    Claudin axis: CLDN3, CLDN4, CLDN7
    EMT/stem axis: VIM, ZEB1, SNAI1, CDH1, FN1
    Stem markers: CD44, CD24, ALDH1A1, KRT14, KRT5
    Immune axis: CD274, CD8A, FOXP3, PDCD1
    TP53 targets: CDKN1A, MDM2, BAX
    Proliferation: MKI67, TOP2A
    HER2 check: ERBB2 (confirm not amplified)
    Drug targets: TACSTD2 (TROP2), BRCA1

STEP 4 — CROSS-SUBTYPE COMPARISON
  Compare claudin-low expression to normal and to
  all completed subtypes (LumA, LumB, TNBC, HER2,
  ILC) on the same gene panel. This generates the
  full breast landscape cross-subtype table.
  The ER axis, the stem axis, and the EMT axis
  should all be readable in a single comparison table.

STEP 5 — WITHIN-GROUP DEPTH AXIS
  Within the claudin-low samples only:
    Correlate CLDN3 with luminal markers (P7 test)
    Correlate VIM with stem markers (P7 test)
    Test whether CLDN3 and VIM are orthogonal
    Identify the depth axis by PCA within claudin-low

STEP 6 — PCA CROSS-SUBTYPE POSITION (P8 test)
  Run PCA on all BRCA subtypes simultaneously.
  Plot claudin-low position relative to all others.
  Measure pairwise distances. Test P8 directly.

## PART VII — WHAT THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT PREDICT

```
This document does NOT predict:
  ✗ Specific DNMT3A or HDAC coupling (as found in LumB)
    There is no geometric basis from the cell-of-origin
    to predict a specific epigenetic co-complex.
    Script 1 may find one — that would be discovered
    from data, not predicted here.

  ✗ A specific survival stratifier within claudin-low
    Survival analysis belongs in Script 2. No survival
    predictions are made here.

  ✗ A specific resistance mechanism to chemotherapy
    The lower pCR of claudin-low vs. TNBC is known
    from the literature. The mechanism from geometry
    alone is: the stem programme is resistant to
    cytotoxic therapy because stem cells are
    quiescence-capable. But the specific molecular
    driver of that resistance in claudin-low is not
    predicted here — it will be derived from data.

  ✗ Claudin-low as a metaplastic subtype
    Metaplastic carcinoma and claudin-low overlap but
    are not synonymous. This analysis addresses
    claudin-low proper. Metaplastic features that
    appear in the data will be noted but are not
    predicted or analysed as a separate class here.
