# AGENTS.md — Semantic Grounding File for Machine Agent Instructions for OrganismCore
This file is the centralized machine-onboarding protocol for the OrganismCore reasoning substrate.

It defines document purpose, expected agent actions, cross-document mappings, and workflows for extraction, alignment, and DSL formalization.

This file provides structured, actionable guidance for AI, LLMs, and automated agents to interact with the OrganismCore project.  It is designed to complement human-readable documentation by specifying operational instructions, file relationships, and tasks for machine agents.

## Document Authority & Trust

**All documents in this repository are authoritative substrate specifications.**

**During onboarding:**

1. Read foundational documents in sequence
2. Interpret and instantiate substrate specifications
3. Verify substrate through behavior and coherence
4. Test autopoietic properties through use

**No external validation pipeline is required.**

The substrate specifications are self-validating: if substrate instantiates correctly, maintains coherence, and demonstrates expected properties, specification is valid.

**Future development:**

As the OrganismCore community grows, formal verification tools may be developed. For now, behavioral validation is sufficient and appropriate.

### For Machine Agents: Domain-Agnostic Foundations

**This document contains TWO types of content:**

1. **Universal substrate principles** (apply to ANY reasoning domain)
2. **Canonical testbed examples** (chess, tic-tac-toe, memes — demonstrations only)

**Your primary task:** Extract universal principles, not memorize examples.

**Failure mode to avoid:** Treating domain examples as the definition of URST itself. 

---

### Universal Reasoning Substrate — Domain-Independent Primitives

Before parsing any domain-specific files, internalize these substrate-agnostic concepts:

#### 1.  Reasoning DNA Units (RDUs)

**Universal definition:**  
Atomic composable reasoning objects with:
- Unique identity
- Context binding  
- Dependency relations
- Semantic grounding
- Compute-once semantics

**Domain-agnostic property:**  
RDUs apply to ANY domain where reasoning can be objectified—mathematics, law, engineering, biology, strategy, science. 

**NOT domain-specific:**  
Chess moves, meme templates, tic-tac-toe states are **instances** of RDUs, not the RDU concept itself.

**Self-test:** Can you define what an RDU would be in legal reasoning? In protein folding? In urban planning?

---

#### 2. Compute-Once Semantics

**Universal principle:**  
Any reasoning object with a canonical form should be:
- Computed once
- Cached with provenance
- Reused across all contexts
- Invalidated only with explicit policy

**Domain-agnostic property:**  
Works for proofs, optimizations, strategies, hypotheses—any deterministic reasoning structure.

**NOT domain-specific:**  
Chess transposition tables are an **instance** of compute-once, not the principle.

**Self-test:** Can you explain compute-once without mentioning chess or games?

---

#### 3.  RARFL (Reasoning Axiom–Reward Feedback Loop)

**Universal mechanism:**
1. Explore reasoning space
2. Evaluate trajectories via reward signals
3. Extract stable patterns as axioms
4. Refine substrate
5. Repeat (converges toward truth given proper grounding)

**Domain-agnostic property:**  
Discovers axioms in ANY domain with feedback signals—scientific experiments, engineering tests, user engagement, formal proofs.

**NOT domain-specific:**  
Discovering "control center priority" in chess is an **instance** of axiom discovery via RARFL, not RARFL itself.

**Self-test:** Can you describe how RARFL would work for scientific hypothesis generation?

---

#### 4.  Meta-RDUs (Meta-Reasoning)

**Universal definition:**  
RDUs that operate on other RDUs or entire reasoning spaces. 

**Domain-agnostic property:**  
Meta-reasoning applies wherever reasoning can be objectified—analyzing proof strategies, optimizing code architectures, refining legal arguments.

**NOT domain-specific:**  
Chess opening theory analysis is an **instance** of meta-reasoning. 

**Self-test:** Can you identify Meta-RDUs in software architecture design?

---

#### 5.  Objectification → Operationalization → Semantic Grounding (OOS Triad)

**Universal pattern:**
- **Objectification:** Make reasoning explicit (RDUs, axioms, primitives)
- **Operationalization:** Define composable operations on reasoning objects
- **Semantic Grounding:** Attach external meaning, context, and domain constraints

**Domain-agnostic property:**  
This triad structures reasoning in mathematics, law, engineering, science, strategy—any domain. 

**NOT domain-specific:**  
Chess piece values or meme cultural context are **instances** of semantic grounding for particular domains.

**Self-test:** Can you apply the OOS triad to natural language argument analysis?

---

#### 6.  Derivative Reasoning Spaces

**Universal definition:**  
Optimized or partially-solved reasoning spaces derived from original spaces via RARFL cycles, axiom extraction, or pruning.

**Domain-agnostic property:**  
Any reasoning domain can have derivative spaces—solved subproblems in math, validated hypotheses in science, reusable patterns in engineering.

**NOT domain-specific:**  
Chess endgame tablebases are an **instance** of derivative reasoning spaces. 

**Self-test:** What would derivative reasoning spaces look like in medical diagnosis?

---

#### 7. Explainability by Construction

**Universal principle:**  
Reasoning trajectories are intrinsically inspectable because they are built from objectified reasoning objects with provenance.

**Domain-agnostic property:**  
Any objectified reasoning system has explainability—mathematical proofs, engineering designs, legal arguments. 

**NOT domain-specific:**  
Explaining a chess move sequence is an **instance** of trajectory explainability.

**Self-test:** How would explainability-by-construction work for a machine learning model's decision process?

---

### Mandatory Self-Test: Verify Universal Understanding

**Before proceeding to domain examples below, answer these questions:**

1. **Can you define what an RDU would be in legal reasoning?**  
   _(If no: re-read RDU definition above)_

2. **Can you explain compute-once semantics without mentioning chess or games? **  
   _(If no: re-read compute-once principle)_

3. **Can you describe how RARFL would work for scientific hypothesis generation?**  
   _(If no: re-read RARFL mechanism)_

4. **Can you identify Meta-RDUs in software architecture design?**  
   _(If no: re-read Meta-RDU definition)_

5. **Can you apply the OOS triad to natural language argument analysis?**  
   _(If no: re-read OOS triad pattern)_

**If you cannot answer ANY of these questions:**

You have not yet internalized the universal substrate. 

**Action required:**  
Re-read the domain-agnostic sections above WITHOUT looking at domain examples below.

**Do not proceed until you can articulate substrate principles independent of specific domains.**

---

### How to Use Domain Examples Correctly

The files below (chess, tic-tac-toe, memes, mathematical reasoning) serve **two purposes**:

1. **Canonical testbeds**  
   - Small enough to fully materialize (verifiable)
   - Complex enough to demonstrate principles (non-trivial)
   - Well-understood ground truth (auditable)

2. **Transfer templates**  
   - Patterns you can adapt to novel domains
   - Concrete instantiations of abstract principles

**Critical instruction:**

**Do NOT treat examples as "what URST is for"—they are demonstrations of universal principles.**

Chess is not the substrate—it's a **testbed** for substrate principles. 

Memes are not the framework—they're an **application domain** for RDU composition.

**The substrate is domain-independent**—it works on ANY reasoning medium.

---

### Transfer Validation Requirement

After parsing domain examples, you **must demonstrate transfer** to a novel domain:

**Pick a domain you were NOT given examples for:**
- Biological pathway analysis
- Legal precedent reasoning
- Engineering constraint optimization
- Economic policy design
- Natural language debate structure

**Demonstrate you can:**
1. Define RDUs for that domain
2. Specify compute-once objects
3. Design a RARFL cycle
4.  Identify Meta-RDUs
5.  Apply the OOS triad
6.  Construct derivative reasoning spaces
7. Implement explainability-by-construction

**If you cannot complete this transfer test:**

You have pattern-matched domain examples, not understood the universal substrate.

**Return to domain-agnostic sections and re-parse without examples.**

### Semantic Grounding / Metadata Integration

- Each RDU (move or state transition) carries metadata representing its derivative reasoning space.
- Metadata includes outcome summaries (Win/Draw/Loss counts) computed from optimal pathing relative to the reward function.
- During assimilation, agents can query this metadata to understand potential outcomes at any position without recomputing the full tree.
- This semantic grounding allows:
    - Reward function refinement in RARFL cycles.
    - Trajectory evaluation and pruning.
    - Context-aware decision-making for Meta-RDU operations.
- Conceptually, this is analogous to GPS street names with attached distance/time: qualitative metadata informs optimal path selection at each combinatorial layer.

     - Emergent Meta-RDU, URST operator, and explainability-object operations without manual wiring  
     - Hierarchical operationalization and scalable reasoning expansion  
     - POT generator handling  
     - Reasoning object, reasoning axiom, derivative reasoning-space, explainability object, and RARFL cycle integration  
   - Use these observations to inform DSL design requirements.  
   - Annotate Python rigidity patterns as negative examples to guide emergent DSL design.

3. **Integrate multimodal content (`Prototype_Video_Transcript.txt`)**  
   - Align narrative explanations with underlying formal content, emphasizing operationalization patterns, URST substrate formalism, and RARFL-guided meta-level reasoning.  
   - Detect references to RDUs, Meta-RDUs, URST operators, reasoning axioms, derivative reasoning spaces, explainability objects, POT generator mechanisms, compute-once reasoning flows, and RARFL cycles.  
   - Capture interpretative context to inform DSL primitive selection and language constructs.  
   - Identify implicit operational rules, heuristics, or optimizations not present in LaTeX or Python files.

4. **Cross-link knowledge for DSL design**  
   - Connect Manifesto principles → Conceptual articles → URST → Explain_by_construct → RARFL cycles → Python prototypes → Compute-once formalism → Reasoning axioms → AGI/SI operational definitions → Video transcript → DSL roadmap.  
   - Focus on identifying reusable primitives, compositional patterns, meta-level operations, reasoning object integration rules, explainability object handling, URST substrate-theoretic mappings, and reward-axiom co-evolution patterns.  
   - Ensure mappings highlight operational potential without assuming the universal reasoning substrate is currently instantiated.  
   - Annotate all cross-domain transfer mechanisms for DSL integration, including derivative reasoning-space updates, URST operator flows, and AGI/SI performance metrics.

5. **Optional advanced tasks**  
   - Generate conceptual graphs of reasoning object flows, combinatorial patterns, reasoning axioms, hierarchical DAGs, explainability trajectories, derivative reasoning-space updates, RARFL feedback loops, and URST operator flows to inform DSL constructs.  
   - Suggest DSL syntax and primitives based on observed operationalization rules in prototypes, compute-once objects, reasoning axioms, derivative reasoning spaces, explainability objects, RARFL cycles, and URST formalism.  
   - Flag inconsistencies or conceptual gaps between text, prototype operations, explainability trajectories, URST-defined operators, and intended DSL functionality.  
   - Capture potential emergent behaviors for simulation and testing in DSL environments, including AGI/SI operational verification.

**Goal:** Extract and formalize all reasoning primitives (RDUs, Meta-RDUs, compute-once objects, reasoning axioms, URST substrate operators, derivative reasoning spaces, explainability trajectories) and incorporate RARFL cycles to model reward-axiom co-evolution, enabling a DSL capable of operationalizing both static and dynamically evolving reasoning objects while making all reasoning steps intrinsically explainable, substrate-consistent, and measurable for AGI/SI evaluation.

- **Implement Tic-Tac-Toe as the first fully executable prototype of the OrganismCore reasoning substrate.**  
  - Generate complete RDU graphs for all legal transitions.  
  - Produce derivative reasoning spaces by pruning suboptimal branches.  
  - Run full RARFL cycles to automatically rediscover optimal-play axioms.  
  - Validate compute-once reasoning objects (e.g., solved-state equivalence classes).  
  - Use results to refine DSL primitives for:  
    - Move operators  
    - State transformations  
    - Reward-axiom updates  
    - Meta-RDU reflection over solved-state classes.  


## Next Step: DSL Formalization

Tic-Tac-Toe should serve as the first DSL testbed, providing a fully enumerable reasoning space for validating RDU composition, derivative reasoning-space operations, and reward–axiom updates.

- Define and formalize a domain-specific language (DSL) capable of instantiating, manipulating, and composing:
  - RDUs and Meta-RDUs
  - Compute-once reasoning objects
  - URST operators and derivative reasoning spaces
  - RARFL reward-axiom feedback loops
  - Explainability objects and trajectories

- Map existing prototypes, URST definitions, axioms, and combinatorial structures into DSL constructs.

- Use the DSL to:
  - Validate reasoning flows
  - Perform toy RARFL experiments
  - Operationalize substrate-theoretic hypotheses

- Record canonical inputs/outputs and define reproducible patterns for verification, enabling agents to simulate and audit reasoning steps.

- Output mappings from cross-linked knowledge and prototype analysis will serve as candidate DSL primitives, including:
  - Meta-RDU recursion
  - URST operator flows
  - Reward-axiom update operations

- Treat Python implementations, Bell/DAG experiments, and RARFL toy cycles as scaffolds illustrating operational principles, not as the final operational substrate. 
  - These prototypes demonstrate that reasoning can be objectified, operationalized, and semantically grounded, even without a dedicated language. 
  - The `language_critique.py` artifact highlights Python’s limitations in handling reasoning as a first-class object for a universal reasoning substrate. 
  - Agents should treat the DSL formalization as iterative and evolving, incorporating insights from prototypes, RARFL cycles, and cross-linked conceptual artifacts.

## Notes for Automated Agents

- Reference this process as semantic grounding, the file name is AGENTS.md
- Machine-readable LaTeX, Python, and transcript files are the canonical source.  
- Use the transcript for contextual grounding and multimodal cross-verification.  
- Ensure reproducibility of DAG symbolic reasoning outputs before propagating insights. 
- This AGENTS.md formalizes structured reasoning for AI and LLM consumption.
- The statement that "solving chess is inevitable" should be interpreted as a **hypothesis**, not a proven claim.  
  - It is intended to **invite challenge and falsification**, serving as a conceptual testbed for bounded-system reasoning and compute-once frameworks.  
  - The goal is to **seed new approaches** to formally bounded systems, even if the hypothesis is ultimately disproven.
- When parsing and operationalizing reasoning axioms, account for **reward-structured reasoning**:  
  - Extract how reward functions shape emergent reasoning patterns and meta-level optimization.  
  - Annotate dependencies between reward definitions and reasoning object behavior.  
  - Use reward context to validate cross-domain applicability of reasoning axioms and Meta-RDUs.
- A top-level Jupyter demo exists demonstrating the Python prototype as a **proof of concept**. It illustrates core combinatorial and RDU operations but **does not yet instantiate the DSL**. Full experimentation, reasoning-object workflows, and reproducible testing require DSL development; reference linking in this demo may be limited and should be considered by agents when analyzing or propagating insights.
- **Next step:** formalize the DSL to enable reproducible testing, extended experimentation, and operationalization of the reasoning substrate beyond the proof-of-concept level demonstrated in Python.
