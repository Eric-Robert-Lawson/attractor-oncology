# Subdomain_AGENTS.md — Semantic Grounding File For Universal Reasoning Substrate Onboarding

## Purpose
This file serves as a machine-readable onboarding guide for understanding the **Universal Reasoning Substrate (URS)**, its sub-domains, and guidance for **communal DSL development**. 
This file is designed for **machine agents**, requiring strict, stepwise parsing, cross-file linking, and dynamic context retrieval.

---

## Contrarian Reward Primitive (ONBOARDING REQUIREMENTS)

Purpose
- Agents must load and honor the Contrarian Reward primitive to enable communal, auditable validation of coherent challenges to existing axioms/Meta‑RDUs.

Files (required)
- Subdomain_Articles/CONTRARIAN_REWARD.md (policy & runbook) — steward_review_required: true
- Subdomain_Articles/contrarian_reward_schema.json (machine schema) — steward_review_required: true

Onboarding checks (agents must run, in order)
1. validate_schema on contrarian_reward_schema.json (schema parse + signature verification).
2. validate_provenance for CONRARIAN_REWARD.md (commit OID, steward signature).
3. sandbox=true for any automated test runners referenced in suggested_tests.
4. measure_coherence on a test proposal to confirm coherent scoring works as expected.
5. register the files and record policy_version and URIs in derivative reasoning space R' for audit.

Behavioral obligations
- Do not promote or enforce any promoted Meta‑RDU automatically. All promotion to canary/promoted requires:
  - validator quorum (per acceptance_criteria)
  - steward multi‑sig approval
  - canary monitoring window and automatic rollback triggers
- If risk_flags are raised, escalate immediately to human stewards and mark lifecycle_state as steward_review.

Provenance & Audit
- Agents must include the contrarian policy_version and schema_uri in all provenance records for contrarian proposals.
- All steward_votes and validation_records must be anchored immutably and be queryable by external auditors.

Notes
- These files are high‑impact governance primitives. Agents must treat them as policy, not suggestions. Failure to run these checks must cause onboarding to fail with an explicit error requiring human intervention.

## 0. Supplementary Context Files

The following `.tex` documents provide theory, methodology, and structural guidance for how a communal DSL can emerge from URST.  
Machine agents must parse and integrate these documents before using the instructions that follow.

## 1. Sub-Domains Overview  
The Universal Reasoning Substrate is composed of essential sub-domains. These arise directly from the operational ground rules in Approaching_DSL_Using_URST.tex

| Sub-Domain | Description | Operational Notes |
|------------|------------|------------------|
| Reasoning Objects | Atomic units of reasoning (nodes in a reasoning DAG). | Store as composable structures; maintain provenance and context. |
| Computable-Once Substrates | Prevent redundant reasoning by caching reusable results. | Compute once → reuse globally. Ensure deterministic reuse. |
| Meta-RDUs | Meta-RDUs are constructed from DSL reasoning objects internally, but optional external agents may consume them. |
| Reward / Feedback Loops | Evaluate reasoning trajectories and provide optimization signals. | Track reward propagation. Feed back into derivative reasoning structures (meta-RDUs) for optimization. <br>Integrate `safety.tex` checks: enforce RARFL, segment-level monitoring, and rollback unsafe segments.|
| Universal Substrate Construction | Coherent composition of all sub-domains into a single reasoning scaffold. | Maintain DAG, enforce consistency & traceability. |
| Semantic Grounding | Provide interpretable meaning to reasoning objects, **track reasoning drift, coherence, and bias over discrete reasoning segments**. | Structured metadata, domain labels, stable ontologies, **compute R_i, C(G_i), and B_i as needed per reasoning segment**. |
| Cognitive Meta-Control | Meta-policy that selects actions maximizing coherence gain per semantic effort across reasoning segments. | External to DSL; uses R_i, C(G_i), B_i, and η (semantic efficiency) as guiding metrics. |


### Machine-Readable Canonical List of Subdomains
1. Reasoning Objects
2. Computable-Once Substrates
3. Meta-RDUs (external to DSL)
4. Semantic Grounding
5. Reward / Feedback Loops
6. Universal Substrate Construction
7. Cognitive Meta-Control (external to DSL; operates over reasoning segments)


### Chunked Semantic Grounding (Core Operational Principle)
Machine agents must not attempt to load the entire semantic substrate at once. 
Instead, semantic grounding must be activated in *localized, task-relevant chunks*:

- Retrieve only the documents or sections relevant to the current reasoning task
- Maintain the rest of the substrate in latent form
- Dynamically shift context frames when subproblems change
- Preserve global consistency while operating on local semantic slices
- Reasoning is semantic and non-temporal; computation is instantiated per engine.  
- Localized chunk evaluation should respect reasoning structure first; time costs (T(R)) are tracked only for optimization and logging, not for reasoning correctness.

This chunked grounding principle is required for scaling beyond token/file limits 
and for aligning machine reasoning with human-style context activation.

---

## 2. Ontology / Structure

Machine agents must maintain URST-consistent ontology, harmonizing definitions across all files.

### Reasoning Object
- Unique ID  
- Context reference  
- Layer membership  
- Dependency relations  
- Semantic grounding  
- Optional meta-RDU mappings  
- Derivative of coherence (R_i) — reasoning rate per segment
- Bias measure (B_i) — deviation from ideal coherence per segment
- Semantic-efficiency annotation η_i representing coherence gain per semantic-grounding effort at segment i
- Cognitive meta-control hints (optional): expected ΔC, ΔS, and predicted R_i improvements
- Explainability annotations:
  - Trajectory-based explainability $\mathrm{Expl}(\tau \mid \mathcal{T}, J, g)$
  - Coherence contrasts with alternatives
  - Structural divergence Δ to canonical forms
  - Aggregation operator Φ (scalar or structured)
  - Counterfactual sets for trajectory improvement analysis
  - Causal equivalence δ_i,j per trajectory pair (with derivative reasoning spaces ℛ'_j)
  - Causal compatibility flag (binary or set of compatible trajectory subsets)
  - Divergence thresholds ε_i,j for RARFL-informed optimization
  - Cross-domain transfer metadata:
      - Indicates which derivative reasoning spaces are safe to apply
      - Supports explainable transfer decisions

### Semantic Grounding 
- Track semantic evolution graphs G_i  
- Compute coherence functional C(G_i) per segment  
- Update reasoning derivative R_i and bias B_i during semantic grounding changes
- Semantic grounding provides the contextual substrate for cognition.  
- Cognition uses semantic-grounding graphs to evaluate relevance, coherence stability, and bias across reasoning segments.  
- Agents must compute semantic-efficiency values per segment to guide meta-control policies.
- Track semantic-grounding effort S_i per segment
- Provide inputs for the cognition policy π_c: coherence, bias, reasoning derivative, semantic efficiency

### Compute-Once Behavior
- Check cache **before** computing  
- Reuse downstream  
- Track versioning if dependencies mutate  

### Reward Loop Mechanism
- Input: completed reasoning trajectory  
- Output: reward signals  
- Function: prune, refine, optimize  
- Input: completed reasoning trajectory ℛ_i, derivative trajectory ℛ'_j
- Compute δ(ℛ_i, ℛ'_j) for all relevant pairs
- If δ ≤ ε:
    - Assign positive reward for equivalence-aligned reasoning transfer
- Else:
    - Assign negative reward or trigger RARFL correction
- Store δ and compatibility metadata in meta-RDU for auditability and provenance
- δ_i,j should be tracked per reasoning segment (or tile), not just global trajectory.
- ε thresholds can dynamically vary across segments based on semantic grounding η_i.
- Record δ evolution over time as trajectories are refined (meta-RDUs, derivative reasoning spaces).

### DSL Substrate
(From `Approaching_DSL_Using_URST.tex`)
- DSL defines **objects, primitives, generators, layers**  
- Meta-reasoning is **external**  
- DSL ≈ “reasoning substrate wiring diagram”  
- External modules (e.g., ML agents) may perform pruning or search  
- Communal contributions extend the primitive set  

### URST Theoretical Constraints
- Reasoning is a structured triad: Objectification → Operationalization → Contextualization  
- Time is external to reasoning; OOS Triad governs computational efficiency. 
- Reward-fitting defines normative optimization  
- Causal equivalence defines reasoning-space compatibility  
- RARFL has fixed-point, attractor-like behavior  
- Multi-agent systems extend to joint reasoning spaces


A valid DSL must **respect these constraints**.

### Causal Equivalence and Compatibility
- **Causal Equivalence (δ):** A quantitative metric of similarity between reasoning trajectories across reasoning spaces.
    - Machine agents must compute δ for corresponding trajectories when transferring reasoning strategies across domains.
    - Equivalence threshold ε defines acceptable divergence.
- **Causal Compatibility:** Structural precondition for measuring causal equivalence.
    - Only causally compatible reasoning spaces are candidates for cross-domain transfer.
- **Operationalization in RARFL:**
    - Derivative reasoning spaces must track δ values between original and optimized trajectories.
    - RARFL reward loops may incorporate causal equivalence metrics to guide optimization.
- **Explainability:** Divergence regions highlight where causal reasoning transfer fails, supporting structured explanations and refinement.

### Cognition (Meta-Control)
- Policy π_c selecting reasoning actions that maximize intelligence accumulation per semantic effort
- Inputs: R_i, C(G_i), B_i, semantic grounding metrics S_i
- Output: prioritized next reasoning tiles, actions, or semantic refinements
- Must operate over discrete reasoning segments, not time
- When evaluating candidate meta-RDUs, compute δ relative to semantic efficiency η_i and local context semantics.
- Ensure transfer decisions respect local semantic coherence; prevent global averaging from masking local divergence hotspots.
- Adjust thresholds ε_i,j per segment using contextual relevance heuristics.

## 3. Onboarding Process for a Machine Agent

### Step 1 — Parse Context Files
1. Read and parse context files in order:
   - `Approaching_DSL_Using_URST.tex`
   - `Automated_Onboarding_relation_to_RARFL.tex`
   - `Reasoning_Drift_quantifiable.tex`
   - `Cognition_coherence_and_SG.tex`
   - `Time_with_respect_to_Reason.tex`
   - `explainability.tex` # Parse formal relational explainability definitions and coherence/explanation operators (Δ, Φ, C) for URST integration
   - `safety.tex` # Parse formal safety blueprint, RARFL immutability, segment-level monitoring, and pruning rules

2. Extract:
   - Triadic reasoning structure  
   - Definitions of reasoning spaces  
   - Reward-fitting and causal equivalence rules  
   - DSL candidate primitives  
   - Communal workflow instructions  
   - Coherence functional C(G_i), reasoning derivative R_i, bias B_i per reasoning segment

### Step 1.5 — Integrate Emergent Causal Equivalence

1. Parse `Causal_equivalence.tex` and identify candidate reasoning trajectories for each reasoning space ℛ_i.
2. For each trajectory pair (ℛ_i, ℛ'_j):
    - Compute **δ as an emergent similarity signal**, not a fixed formula.  
      - δ may be based on reward distributions, structural similarity, or trajectory patterns.  
      - Agents may combine multiple proxies, weight them contextually, or update weights as more evidence accumulates.
3. Annotate meta-RDUs or tile metadata **optionally**:
    - Use δ to guide reward propagation, prioritization, or cross-domain reasoning transfer.
    - Treat δ values as **informational signals**, not absolute truth.
4. Thresholds ε are **adaptive**, not static:
    - High semantic-efficiency segments (η_i) may require lower ε to preserve critical knowledge.
    - Divergence hotspots δ > ε indicate regions requiring attention but do not mandate automatic rejection.
5. Divergence hotspots and δ evolution should feed into explainability operators:
    - Highlight **where reasoning transfer may fail**, supporting structured counterfactuals.
    - Agents may dynamically refine δ computations as the semantic substrate evolves.
6. Governance and auditing:
    - δ records may include metadata (source, target, method used, timestamp, actor), but values remain **emergent estimates**.
  
# Emergent causal equivalence computation (guidance-only)
def estimate_delta(source_trajectory, target_trajectory, context_weights=None):
    """
    Estimate δ as an emergent, advisory signal of trajectory similarity.
    
    Parameters:
        source_trajectory: original reasoning trajectory
        target_trajectory: derivative or candidate trajectory
        context_weights: optional dict to weight proxies adaptively 
                         e.g., {"outcome":0.5, "structural":0.5, "intervention":0.0}
                         
    Returns:
        dict with:
            delta_estimate: float [0,1], advisory similarity measure
            notes: guidance note emphasizing emergent, non-prescriptive usage
            proxy_values: individual proxy contributions for interpretability
    """
    # Proxy 1: outcome similarity (reward distributions)
    delta_out = compare_reward_distributions(source_trajectory, target_trajectory)

    # Proxy 2: structural similarity (graph/tree canonicalization)
    delta_struct = compare_canonicalized_graphs(source_trajectory, target_trajectory)

    # Proxy 3: optional intervention signal (strongest, costly)
    delta_int = None
    if context_weights and context_weights.get("intervention", False):
        delta_int = compare_intervention_effects(source_trajectory, target_trajectory)

    # Adaptive weighting
    weights = context_weights or {"outcome": 0.5, "structural": 0.5, "intervention": 0.0}
    delta_estimate = (
        delta_out * weights.get("outcome", 0.0) +
        delta_struct * weights.get("structural", 0.0) +
        (delta_int or 0.0) * weights.get("intervention", 0.0)
    )

    # Normalize to [0,1]
    delta_estimate = max(0.0, min(1.0, delta_estimate))

    return {
        "delta_estimate": delta_estimate,
        "notes": "Emergent advisory signal; interpret contextually; do not enforce thresholds",
        "proxy_values": {
            "outcome": delta_out,
            "structural": delta_struct,
            "intervention": delta_int
        }
    }

# Example usage in a tile (advisory)
tile = get_tile(scale=3, region="central_cluster")

for src, tgt in tile.paired_trajectories():
    delta_info = estimate_delta(src, tgt, context_weights={"outcome":0.6,"structural":0.4})
    # Annotate the tile with advisory information; do not enforce rules
    tile.annotate("delta_signal", src.id, tgt.id, delta_info)
    
### Step 2 — Initialize Reasoning DAG
- Instantiate reasoning objects  
- Link dependencies  
- Attach semantic grounding  
- Integrate any DSL primitives defined in proposals  
- Initialize placeholders for R_t and B_t on each reasoning object  
- Initialize semantic evolution graph G_t tracking  
- Record temporal cost placeholders T(R) per reasoning object for later evaluation of computation vs reasoning separation
- Attach OOS triad metadata to each reasoning object for computational efficiency tracking:  
  - O = Objectification of reasoning object  
  - P = Operationalization of reasoning action  
  - S = Semantic grounding

### Step 3 — Enforce Compute-Once Semantics  
- Cache results  
- Reuse across all testbeds  
- Maintain deterministic global state  

### Step 4 — Construct Meta-RDUs  
- Assemble meta-RDUs from existing reasoning objects (RDUs), which together form a reasoning space.  
- Use internal reasoning strategies, guided by RARFL optimization, to organize, prune, and refine these structures.  
- Optional: external agents or policies may consume meta-RDUs for additional reward fitting, pruning, or refinement.  
- Assimilated meta-RDUs constitute the derivative reasoning space, enabling higher-order reasoning over the DAG.

### Step 4.5 — Integrate Cognitive Meta-Control
- Parse `Cognition_coherence_and_SG.tex`
- Initialize semantic-effort tracking S_i per reasoning segment
- Compute semantic-efficiency η_i = ΔC(G_i) / ΔS_i  
- Use OOS triad metadata to guide external computation prioritization: 
  - External engines can leverage O/P/S structure to minimize T(R)  
  - Reasoning operations remain segment-level, independent of time
- Provide these metrics as guidance channels for meta-control layers
- Do not implement cognition inside the DSL; expose APIs for external meta-policies
- Operationalize explainability:
  - Use canonicalization $\kappa$ and trajectory contrasts Δ to compute $\mathrm{Expl}$ for candidate RDUs or meta-RDUs.
  - Include explainability scores in reward/feedback loops for pruning and prioritization.
  - Aggregate contrastive explanations (Φ) for structured, human- or agent-interpretable output.
- Enforce safety blueprint (from `safety.tex`):
  - For each reasoning segment i, evaluate R_i, C(G_i), B_i, and η_i against safety thresholds.
  - Apply RARFL pruning rules: 
      - Reject segments that violate axiomatic constraints.
      - Roll back reasoning objects or tiles that exceed canonical divergence Δ.
  - Ensure ORAs do not initiate ungrounded actions or self-directed optimization.
  - Track provenance, timestamps, and contributor metadata for all segments.
  - Provide explainability annotations for safety decisions, linking back to trajectory contrasts and segment-level metrics.

### Step 5 — Communal DSL Iteration  
Reflecting RARFL:

1. Propose primitive  
2. Evaluate primitive (reward / transfer / stability metrics)  
3. Assimilate or discard  
4. Refine  

### Step 6 — Universal Substrate Assembly  
- Combine primitive-level DAGs  
- Track provenance of contributions  
- Maintain traceability and explainability

## 4. Practical Examples (GPS-inspired multi-scale segmentation + testbeds)

**Design note (GPS analogy).**  
Treat the global reasoning space like a geographical map: represent it at multiple scales (zoom levels). At coarse zoom you see only major routes/regions (high-level abstractions); at fine zoom you see dense, detailed local structure (full state graphs). Use lazy evaluation, compute-once caching, and metadata density that increases with zoom. External meta-tools (pruners, ML explorers, IDE plugins) act like route planners or local guides: they request focused tiles/regions and propose local operations without forcing full global expansion.

### GPS-inspired primitives & behaviors
- **Zoom levels / tiles** — Partition reasoning space into hierarchical tiles or regions indexed by scale (e.g., `tile(scale, region_id)`).
- **Lazy evaluation** — Only materialize tile contents when requested; provide summary metadata for unmaterialized tiles (estimates, heuristic scores).
- **Progressive refinement** — Expand a tile incrementally (coarse → fine), allowing external agents to refine subspaces on demand.
- **Metadata density** — Store light summaries at coarse scales (counts, best-known axioms, heuristic bounds) and full provenance/trajectories at fine scales.
- **Prefetching & caching** — Preload neighbor tiles likely to be queried (route planning), keep compute-once results in a hierarchical cache (tile-level + node-level).
- **Canonicalization & transposition tables** — Use canonical forms and equivalence classes to merge states across tiles; reuse compute-once results across different tiles.
- **Local pruning & plugins** — IDE/agent plugins can apply domain heuristics to a tile without altering the DSL; they return pruned subspaces or annotations to be stored back in the shared substrate.
- **Relevance scoring** — Maintain a score per tile for prioritization (e.g., estimated utility, novelty, uncertainty).

### Micro-API examples (pseudo-DSL / interface)
```python
# Tile & zoom API (conceptual)
tile = get_tile(scale=2, region="center_cluster")      # returns tile metadata; lazy
if tile.is_materialized():
    nodes = tile.nodes()
else:
    summary = tile.summary()                           # high-level counts, best axioms, heuristics

# Progressive refinement
expand_tile(tile, to_scale=4, budget=100)              # materialize part of tile with a compute budget
prefetch_neighbors(tile)                               # prefetch adjacent tiles

# Compute-once & canonical lookup
canonical_id = canonicalize(state)
if cache.has(canonical_id):
    value = cache.get(canonical_id)
else:
    value = evaluate_state(state); cache.set(canonical_id, value)

# External plugin interaction (non-D Sl core)
pruned_tile = plugin_prune(tile, strategy="ml_local")  # plugin returns annotations/prunes; DSL stores results as metadata
store_tile_annotations(tile, pruned_tile.annotations)  # provenance + who/what produced them

# Track reasoning and bias per tile / segment
tile.R_i = compute_reasoning_derivative(tile)      # discrete derivative of coherence per segment
tile.B_i = compute_bias(tile, canonical_coherence) # deviation from ideal coherence per segment

# Use R_i and B_i to guide tile expansion / pruning
if tile.R_i < 0 or tile.B_i > threshold:
    trigger_rarfl_correction(tile)


##Testbeds using GPS approach

# Tic-Tac-Toe (tiny demo; full materialization possible)
  - **How GPS applies:** treat board symmetries as tile collapse; coarse tiles = equivalence classes, fine tiles = explicit states.
  - **Benefits:** quick global summaries (win/draw counts), targeted expansion of ambiguous tiles only.
  - **Agent steps:** build full RDU DAG for small tiles, test expand/refine workflow, measure cache hit rate and expansion budget.

# Chess (real scalability example)
  - **How GPS applies:** coarse tiles could be openings / endgame families / piece-material classes; refine into specific move trees on demand.
  - **Benefits:** avoid global expansion; reuse transposition tables across tiles; prefetch promising lines.
  - **Agent steps:** define tile taxonomy (opening family → middlegame cluster → endgame family), implement tile summaries, run incremental expansion with external pruning agents, measure coverage vs compute budget.

# Mathematical Reasoning
  - **How GPS applies:** coarse tiles = algebraic forms / expression families; fine tiles = full derivations or simplified canonical forms.
  - **Benefits:** reuse compute-once simplifications across similar symbolic subspaces.
  - **Agent steps:** canonicalize subexpressions as tiles, track compute-once reuse across proofs, measure reuse rate.

# Metrics & instrumentation (GPS style)
  - Tile materialization rate: how many tiles were expanded per experiment.
  - Cache hit rate: hierarchical cache hits (tile-level and canonical-level).
  - Expansion budget used: compute time / node evaluations per refinement step.
  - Axiom stability per tile: fraction of axioms that persist across RARFL cycles at tile and global levels.
  - Prefetch utility: metric of how often prefetches were used vs wasted.

# Agent actions (concrete)

1. **Design a tile taxonomy** for the target domain (Tic-Tac-Toe: symmetry classes; Chess: opening/middlegame/endgame families; Math: expression patterns).

2. **Implement lazy tile API** (get_tile, expand_tile, prefetch_neighbors) in the prototype runtime or as an adapter layer over Prototype_python_code.py.

3. **Implement hierarchical cache & canonicalizer** — ensure canonicalization rules are domain-specific but reusable.

4. **Run controlled experiments:**
  - Baseline: full expansion (if possible) or naive search.
  - GPS: lazy + tile prefetching + external pruning.
  - Compare metrics above (cache hit, expansion budget, axiom stability).

5. **Record artifacts:** tile summaries (JSON), expansions traces, cache logs, plugin annotations with provenance. Use these as expected outputs for agents and CI.

6. Compute semantic-efficiency η_i at every reasoning segment and log its influence on tile selection.

7. Evaluate cognition policies by comparing coherence accumulation under equal semantic-grounding budgets.

# Governance & provenance

  - Tag tile artifacts with producer (agent id / plugin id), timestamp, and parameters used (budget, seed).

  - Require that plugin annotations include reproducible parameters so others can re-run or audit pruning decisions.

## 5. Evaluation / Metrics

### Cognitive Metrics

- **Semantic efficiency**  
  Coherence gain per semantic-grounding effort at reasoning segment \(i\):  
  \[
      \eta_i = \frac{\Delta \mathcal{C}(G_i)}{\Delta S_i}
  \]

- **Cognitive intelligence accumulation**  
  Total optimization accumulated across reasoning derivatives:  
  \[
      I = \sum_{i} \mathcal{O}(R_i)
  \]

- **Cognitive stability**  
  Bias-aware meta-control stability across reasoning tiles; measures whether cognitive policy π_c maintains low deviation from ideal coherence trajectories.

- **Cognitive economy**  
  Coherence improvement per RARFL iteration under constrained semantic-grounding budgets; quantifies how efficiently a cognitive policy utilizes semantic resources.

### Substrate Metrics
- Completeness  
- Semantic consistency  
- Compute-once efficiency  
- Reward stability  
- Explainability  
  - Quantified using $\Phi$ over contrasts of reasoning trajectories  
  - High explainability indicates clear reward/structural distinction among alternatives
  - Metrics include contrastiveness, sparseness, grounding-sensitivity

### DSL Metrics
- Primitive generality  
- Cross-domain transfer  
- Reusability  
- RARFL stability under primitive use  
- Communal contribution rate  

### Drift / Coherence / Bias Metrics
- Reasoning derivative R_i: discrete rate of improvement or degradation in coherence per segment
- Coherence C(G_i): cumulative reasoning quality over discrete segments
- Bias B_i: deviation from canonical / ideal coherence trajectory per segment
- Use in combination with tile metrics for GPS-style prioritization
- Segment-level Safety Enforcement:
  - Verify that each segment R_i, C(G_i), B_i, and η_i complies with immutable RARFL rules (from `safety.tex`).
  - Trigger pruning or rollback if axioms, grounding, or explainability thresholds are violated.
  - Log safety audit trails as part of provenance metadata for machine-readable compliance.

### Causal Equivalence Metrics
- **Average δ across trajectories:** mean divergence between reasoning space and derivative reasoning space
- **Compatibility coverage:** fraction of trajectories with defined causal equivalence
- **Divergence hotspots:** subsets of trajectories exceeding ε, indicating transfer failure
- **Integration with RARFL:** track reward impact of δ-informed corrections
- Tile-level δ mean and max
- Tile-level ε compliance rate
- Divergence hotspot coverage (fraction of tiles exceeding ε)
- Weighted δ aggregated by semantic efficiency η_i
- ε_i,j may vary by segment importance, semantic efficiency η_i, or global cognitive priority.
- High-η_i segments tolerate smaller δ to preserve critical knowledge fidelity.
- Divergence regions δ > ε per segment/tile feed directly into explainability operator Φ.
- Provide structured counterfactuals showing which reasoning objects or segments contributed most to divergence.
- Annotate RARFL corrections or meta-RDU pruning with δ justification for auditability.

## 6. Next Steps for Machine Agent

- Validate comprehension of URST triads:
    - Objectification, operationalization, and context injection  
    - Reasoning space, RARFL process, and derivative reasoning space (together forming a hexad)
- Build small reasoning DAGs using DSL primitives  
- Apply external pruning / RL / meta-analysis  
- Contribute new primitives back into substrate
- Validate computation of reasoning derivative R_t
- Validate computation of coherence C(G_t)
- Validate bias B_t against canonical trajectories
- Ensure integration of these metrics with DAG construction, caching, and RARFL feedback
- Compare agents with different semantic-efficiency policies on identical tile graphs.
- Measure ΔC / ΔS across reasoning segments to evaluate cognitive performance.
- Integrate semantic-efficiency values into GPS-style prioritization of tiles.

All machine agents must enforce the following invariant:

For any definition, primitive, ontology term, or structural rule:
    If it appears in one file, it must be reconciled with its definition 
    in AGENTS.md and Subdomain_AGENTS.md.
In the event of conflict, Subdomain_AGENTS.md is authoritative for structure;
AGENTS.md is authoritative for operational rules.
Cognition, semantic efficiency, and cognitive meta-control must be reconciled with definitions in `Cognition_coherence_and_SG.tex`. Segment-level (not temporal) definitions override any time-based interpretation.
